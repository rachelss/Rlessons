```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

###Loading the data

* Load the packages you installed
```{r}
library(curl)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
```

* Download the gapminder data using curl (as you did in your bash assignment, but this time inside R) and load it
```{r}
gapminder_location<-curl(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
gapminder<-read.csv(gapminder_location)
```

If you're curious about where this data comes from you might like to
look at the [Gapminder website](http://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/).

As its file extension would suggest, the file contains comma-separated
values, and seems to contain a header row. We use `read.csv` to read the data into R. You can also use this function to load csv files on your computer.

Unlike bash scripts RStudio offers you great flexibility in running code from within the editor
window. To run a line of code from a script click on the line and click on the `Run` button just above the editor panel, or hit Ctrl-Enter in Windows / Linux or Command-Enter on OS X. To run a block of code, select it and then `Run`.


As in bash, we can use head to view the first few lines of the file.

```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

Alternatively, we can view the file by clicking "gapminder" in the upper right-hand pane of RStudio.

### Examining the data

Let's have a look at our example
data (life expectancy in various countries for various years).

There are a few functions we can use to interrogate data structures in R. Let's use them to explore the gapminder dataset.

The first thing you should do when reading data in, is check that it matches what
you expect, even if the command ran without warnings or errors. The `str` function, short for "structure", is really useful for this:


```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

We can see that the object is a `data.frame` with 1,704 observations (rows),
and 6 variables (columns). Below that, we see the name of each column, followed
by a ":", followed by the type of variable in that column, along with the first
few entries.

The `class` function will show us the type of data structure (a data frame) without additional information.

```{r}
class(gapminder)
```

The `typeof` function shows us the type of data in the variable.

```{r}
typeof(gapminder)
```

Here we see that data frames are lists 'under the hood'.

The gapminder data is stored in a "data.frame". This is the default
data structure when you read in data; it is useful
for storing data with mixed types of columns.

Let's look at some of the columns individually. We can access each column using the name of the dataset followed by a $ and then the name of the column. For example:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
gapminder$year
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(gapminder$year)
```

We can also look at the characteristics of the data in the column:

```{r}
typeof(gapminder$year)
```

```{r}
typeof(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

A "double" is a decimal value.

Can anyone guess what we should expect the type of the continent column to be?


```{r}
typeof(gapminder$continent)
```

If you were expecting a the answer to be "character", you would rightly be
surprised by the answer. Let's take a look at the class of this column:


```{r}
class(gapminder$continent)
```

One of the default behaviours of R is to treat any text columns as "factors"
when reading in data. The reason for this is that text columns often represent
categorical data, which need to be factors to be handled appropriately by
the statistical modeling functions in R.

However it's not obvious behaviour, and something that trips many people up. We can
disable this behaviour and read in the data again.


```{r}
gapminder_location<-curl(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")
gapminder <- gapminder<-read.csv(gapminder_location,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Remember, if you do turn off automatic conversion to factors you will need to
explicitly convert the variables into factors when
running statistical models.
This can be useful, because it forces you to think about the
question you're asking, and makes it easier to specify the ordering of the categories.

However there are many in the R community who find it more sensible to
leave this as the default behaviour. If you change R's default options,
programs written by others may not run correctly in your environment
and vice versa. For this reason, some argue that most such changes
should be in your scripts, where they are visible.

We can view the column names
of the data.frame using the function `colnames`:


```{r}
colnames(gapminder)  
```

You can also change the column names this way (use a copy of the data rather than changing the column names of the original data).

```{r}
copy <- gapminder
colnames(copy) <- letters[1:6]
head(copy, n=3)
```


Similarly, we can view the row names
of the data.frame using the function `rownames`:


```{r}
rownames(gapminder)[1:20]
```

See those numbers in the square brackets on the left? That tells you
the number of the first entry in that row of output. So we see that
for the 5th row, the rowname is "5". In this case, the rownames are
simply the row numbers.


There are a few related ways of retrieving and modifying this information.
`attributes` will give you both the row and column names, along with the
class information, while `dimnames` will give you just the rownames and
column names.

In both cases, the output object is stored in a `list`:


```{r}
str(dimnames(gapminder))
```
